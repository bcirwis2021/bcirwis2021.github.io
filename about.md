#### Project abstract

Data is often available in matrix form, in which columns are samples, and 
processing of such data often entails finding an approximate factorisation of 
the matrix in two factors. The first factor yields recurring patterns 
characteristic of the data. The second factor describes in which proportions 
each data sample is made of these patterns. Latent factor estimation (LFE) 
is the problem of finding such a factorisation, usually under given constraints. 
LFE appears under other domain-specific names such as 
**dictionary learning**, **low-rank approximation**, **factor analysis** or 
**latent semantic analysis**. It is used for tasks such as dimensionality 
reduction, unmixing, soft clustering, coding or matrix completion in very diverse fields.

In this project, we propose to explore three new paradigms that push the 
frontiers of traditional LFE. The first objective is to break beyond the 
ubiquitous Gaussian assumption, a practical choice that too rarely complies 
with the nature and geometry of the data. Estimation in **non-Gaussian models** 
is more difficult, but recent work in audio and text processing has shown 
that it pays off in practice. Second, in traditional settings the data 
matrix is often a collection of features computed from raw data. 
These features are computed with generic off-the-shelf transforms 
that loosely preprocess the data, setting a limit to performance. 
We propose to explore a new paradigm in which an optimal **low-rank inducing 
transform** is learnt together with the factors in a single step. 
Thirdly, we propose to reconsider the dominant deterministic approach to 
LFE and explore a novel statistical estimation paradigm, 
based on the **marginal likelihood**, with enhanced capabilities. 
The new methodology is applied to real-world problems in **audio signal 
processing** (speech enhancement, music remastering), 
**remote sensing** (Earth observation, cosmic object discovery) and **data mining**
(multimodal information retrieval, user recommendation).
