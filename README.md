This is the source code for the project FACTORY  [https://projectfactory.github.io/](https://projectfactory.github.io/). This is a Jekyll powered site. Jekyll is the software used by Github to transform *markdown* or *liquid* instructions into html. This is very practical to build simple, elegant websites hosted by Github. 

# For final users
In this section we cover the typical use cases. To edit things online, just edit a file and commit. Github will re-generate the *_site* folder and the site will be updated.

## Add a team member

Just add the member information in the `/data/members.yaml` file.

	- name: a name 
	  status: principal | advisor | postdoc | phd | alumni | whatever
	  position: a position title
	  homepage: http://www.membersite.net
	  googlescholar: "https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=myuser123"
	  orcid:    0000-0001-1234-5678
	  github:  a github username
	  twitter: a twitter username
	  email:   a valid email 
	  photo:   a filename to be found in /img/

If status is `advisor` or `alumni` the member will be placed in the advisors or alumni section, respectively. All the other members are presented respecting the order in `members.yaml`.`name`, `status`, `position`, and `email` are mandatory fields.

## Update the publications list

You can just copy paste the output of your JabRef and name it `publications.html` 
However, it will appear as a stand-alone page without the menu and the style of the site. In order to fix this, the `publicatons.html` file should be:

	---
	layout: publications
	title: publications
	---

	<table id="qstable" border="1">
	# Jabref content
	</table>

The JabRef file will contain a full html document. You **only** have to copy-paste the `qstable` into the above file, and the `publications` layout will do the rest.

## Add some openings 

Openings are hard coded in the `index.md`. Just add a new html line (see the `<li>` lines) with references or anything you need:


	<section id="openings" class="container" style='padding-top:0rem; margin-top:-2rem;'>
	<div class="row text-xs-center">
	  <div class="col-xs">
	    <h1>openings</h1>
	  </div>
	</div>

	<div class="row flex-items-xs-center text-xs-justify">
	  <div class="col-md-9">
	     <p class="text-xs-center">
	     <ul>
		   <li><h5> Open postdoc positions for <a href="http://projectfactory.irit.fr/postdoccall.pdf"> our project </a> </h5></li>
		   <li><h5> Open PhD positions for <a href="http://projectfactory.irit.fr/phdcall.pdf"> our project </a> </h5></li>
		 </ul>
	    </p>
	  </div>
	</div>
	</section>

## Add some news

Just add the information in the `/data/news.yaml` file:

	  - date: 2017-02-28
	    title: Julia won the Nobel Prize
	    description: Our team member Julia Backprop won the Nobel Prize for is work in Deep Quantic Tensor Factorization.
	    downloads :
	      - href: http://www.linknobel.org/juliaquanticnobel.html
		desc: description of the href


# For developers: Site structure 

### `./`
The root folder contains this README, a LICENSE file, a `_config.yml` to specify some general attributes of the site, and then the web pages: `index.md`, `about.md` , `publications.html`, `team.html`... Some of these files use Liquid tags from Jekyll (e.g.: `<% this is an instruction %>`) to include code snippets that will help to create the final html page. If a page in the root has extension .md, markdown content will be parsed into html and the final page will have the .html extension.

### `_data/`
Contains YAML files (JSON files are also accepted) with content that will be read and properly presented in some parts of the site (list of members, news)

### `_includes/`
Contains code snippets that can be inserted in any part of the site by using `<% include filename.html %>`

### `_layouts/`
A couple of layouts for html documents specifying margins, html headers, navigation bars, and so on.  If we want to format a page with a given layout, e.g., `section` layout, we just need to add this header to our page:

	---
	layout: section
	---

	and then write our content here


### `_saas/`
Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets. Just some advanced CSS. 

### `_site/`  
Public site automatically generated by Github after processing the Jekyll instructions (e.g.: liquid tags).
 
### `css/`
CSS files.

### `files/`
pdf and other user files can be stored here. 

### `img/`
Images can be stored here.
