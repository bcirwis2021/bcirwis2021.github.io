# Call For Papers
## CausalBayes 2021: Bayesian causal inference for real world interactive systems

Increasingly we use machine learning to build interactive systems that learn from past actions and the reward obtained.  Theory suggests several possible approaches, such as contextual bandits, reinforcement learning, the do-calculus, or plain old Bayesian decision theory.  What are the most theoretically appropriate and practical approaches to doing causal inference for interactive systems?  

**We are particularly interested in case studies of applying machine learning methods to interactive systems that _did_ or _did_ _not_ use Bayesian or _likelihood_ based methods, with a discussion about why this choice was made in terms of practical or theoretical arguments**.  We also welcome submissions in the following areas:

* Offline evaluation of recommender and interactive systems.
* Comparison of Bayesian, off-policy and other heuristic approaches for offline metrics.
* Probabilistic approaches applied to contextual bandits and reinforcement learning approaches.
* Probabilistic approaches to incrementality and attribution.
* Non-Bayesian approaches and trade-offs with Bayesian/Likelihood approaches.
* Bayesian methods in a production environment.

Papers should be a three (3) page extended abstract, and will be selected for contributed talks or for posters.  Papers should be formated using the [ACM Proceedings Format](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template).

If the research has previously appeared in a journal, workshop, or conference (including KDD 2021), the workshop submission should extend that previous work. Parallel submissions (such as to other conferences) are permitted.

Paper Submission Deadline: May 10th, 2021
Paper Notification: June 10th, 2021
