# Call For Papers
## BCIRWIS 2021: Bayesian causal inference for real world interactive systems

Increasingly we use machine learning to build interactive systems that learn from past actions and the reward obtained.  Theory suggests several possible approaches, such as contextual bandits, reinforcement learning, the do-calculus, or plain old Bayesian decision theory.  What are the most theoretically appropriate and practical approaches to doing causal inference for interactive systems?  We are particularly interested in case studies of applying machine learning methods to interactive systems that _did_ or _did_ _not_ use Bayesian or likelihood based methods with a discussion about why this choice was made in terms of practical or theoretical arguments.

We invite papers on any aspect of Bayesian inference for real world interactive systems including:

* Offline evaluation of recommender and interactive systems.
* Bayesian methods in a production environment.
* Comparison of Bayesian, off-policy and other heuristic approaches for offline metrics.
* Probabilistic approaches applied to contextual bandits and reinforcement learning approaches.
* Probabilistic approaches to incrementality and attribution.
* Non-Bayesian approaches and trade-offs with Bayesian approaches.
* Contextual bandit algorithms.

Papers should be a three (3) page extended abstract, and will be selected for contributed talks or for posters.  Papers should be formated using the [ACM Proceedings Format](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template).

If the research has previously appeared in a journal, workshop, or conference (including KDD 2021), the workshop submission should extend that previous work. Parallel submissions (such as to other conferences) are permitted.

Paper Submission Deadline: May 10th, 2021
Paper Notification: June 10th, 2021
